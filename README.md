# Course on Running Computer Services

Inspired by Jessie Frazelle's Tweet "[... any college CS courses require running services](https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/1586468426943324161?s=20&t=XXO6R-FdLdDtfERGacMnBQ)"

The goal of this repository is to collect content for a course that anyone capable and willing can start using it to teach students. The course will cover:

-   Basics of CS, Operating Systems, Processes, Networking and Storage
-   How to get started by running their own services at their home lab
-   How to simulate various commonly occuring failure scenarios
-   The process of debugging
-   Blameless Retrospectives
-   How to get "clients" that are willing to let the students intern for their services
-   How to pay forward by enhancing this course

## The Goal for the Professor

Again inspired by Jessie Frazelle's Tweet "[I want to teach this class because](https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/1586473046411395072?s=20&t=XXO6R-FdLdDtfERGacMnBQ)"


> * It will be super fun
> * In the moment kids will hate it and not understand why this is so hard
> * Ten years after they'll (hopefully) say its the one CS class they still use everyday
> * Getting to be the professor everyone respects but from time to time they strongly dislike them and so they have a tension between respect
> and hate.

## Next Steps
* Come up with course structure
* Add initial content
* Get "customers"
